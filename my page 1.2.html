<p> Hey! I'm Daniela, I go to Mt. Eden High School where I am a upcoming junior. I have lived in Hayward for about 13 years now. I'm Mexican, my Mom is from Sinaloa and my Dad
  from Jalisco. I'm 16 years old as of 2017. Currently I'm going to a program called Girls Who
  Code and I have learned so much about coding through this program and I am so grateful that I can learn something new about coding.</p>
